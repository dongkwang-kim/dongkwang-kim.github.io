I am a second-year master's student in the [Graduate School of Data Science](https://gsds.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Professor Hyungsoo Jung](https://hyungsoo-jung.github.io/). Before starting my studies, I served as Deputy Director at the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea](https://www.mofa.go.kr/eng/index.do) for four and a half years. I earned my bachelor's degree in Sociology, with a minor in Korean Language and Literature, also from Seoul National University. My research focuses on memory and storage systems to accelerate AI/ML workloads.
