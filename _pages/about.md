I am a second-year MS student in [Graduate School of Data Science](https://gsds.snu.ac.kr/) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), where I am advised by [Prof. Hyungsoo Jung](https://hyungsoo-jung.github.io/). Before my study, I served as Deputy Director at [Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of Korea](https://www.mofa.go.kr/eng/index.do) for four and half years. I got my bachelor's degree in Sociology(minor: Korean Language and Literature) also at Seoul National University.

My research interest is in memory and storage systems to accelerate AI/ML workload.
